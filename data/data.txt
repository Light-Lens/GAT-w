The human eye can perceive a vast range of colors, but it is challenging to provide an exact number for the colors a human eye can see "at a glance." The human eye has three types of cone cells, each sensitive to different wavelengths of light. These cones allow us to perceive colors across the visible spectrum, which ranges from approximately 390 to 700 nanometers in wavelength.

The human eye can discern numerous distinct colors and shades, including different hues, saturations, and brightness levels. However, the exact number of colors a person can perceive is difficult to quantify and depends on various factors, including individual differences in color perception, lighting conditions, and the context in which the colors are presented.

Some studies suggest that humans can distinguish millions of different colors, while others propose a more conservative estimate of around 100,000. Additionally, factors such as color blindness and age-related changes in the eye can influence color perception.

It's important to note that color perception is a complex and subjective process, influenced not only by the eye's physical capabilities but also by the brain's interpretation of visual information. As a result, the actual number of colors a human can see at a glance is challenging to define precisely. Nonetheless, it's safe to say that the human eye can perceive a rich and diverse range of colors in the world around us.
