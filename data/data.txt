how many photons can human eye detect at maximum at a time
The human eye is a remarkable organ capable of detecting and processing light. The basic light-sensitive unit in the eye is the photoreceptor cell, which comes in two types: rods and cones. Rods are more sensitive to low light conditions and are responsible for night vision, while cones are responsible for color vision and work best in brighter light.
The exact number of photons that the human eye can detect at a given time is a challenging question to answer precisely. The sensitivity of the eye varies with light conditions, individual differences, and the location on the retina where the light falls.
In ideal laboratory conditions, researchers have reported that individual rod cells can respond to single photons. This means that in very dim conditions, a person might be able to perceive a single photon being detected by a single rod cell in their eye. However, this is an extreme and rare situation, and in real-world scenarios, many factors come into play that affect our ability to perceive individual photons.
In normal daylight conditions, the eye receives a continuous stream of photons, and it's impossible to perceive them individually. Instead, our visual system processes these photons into a coherent image that we perceive as the objects and scenes around us.

how to many colors can a human eye see at a glance
The human eye can perceive a vast range of colors, but it is challenging to provide an exact number for the colors a human eye can see "at a glance." The human eye has three types of cone cells, each sensitive to different wavelengths of light. These cones allow us to perceive colors across the visible spectrum, which ranges from approximately 390 to 700 nanometers in wavelength.
The human eye can discern numerous distinct colors and shades, including different hues, saturations, and brightness levels. However, the exact number of colors a person can perceive is difficult to quantify and depends on various factors, including individual differences in color perception, lighting conditions, and the context in which the colors are presented.
Some studies suggest that humans can distinguish millions of different colors, while others propose a more conservative estimate of around 100,000. Additionally, factors such as color blindness and age-related changes in the eye can influence color perception.
